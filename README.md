The MATLAB code provided here includes several optimization algorithms (purely sequential or batch) using Gaussian processes. Available algorithms include GP-UCB, EI, Chaining-UCB for sequential optimization, and GP-UCB-PE, GP-B-UCB for batch optimization. The implementation uses efficient updating formulae in order to remain scalable to a large number of training points.
